SUA Outsmarting Outbreaks Challenge Solution ðŸš€

The goal of this challenge was to develop a model to predict outbreaks of climate-sensitive waterborne diseases such as typhoid, amoebiasis, diarrhea, schistosomiasis, and intestinal worms in Tanzania.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Climate-sensitive waterborne diseases pose significant health risks, especially for vulnerable populations. Using datasets comprising water sources, toilet quality, waste management, health facility data, and climate information (2019-2023), the objective was to build a predictive model to help governments and health organizations implement timely interventions.
